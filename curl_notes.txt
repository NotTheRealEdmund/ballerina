Use curl in cmd to make HTTP requests without a web browser.
For example, after you've run: ballerina run hello_world.bal in the cmd in VS code,
open up another cmd (not in VS code) and run: curl localhost:9090/ and you will see Hello World! 
without having to open up a web browser.

To pass the "Edmund" string parameter to POST method:
curl -X POST -d "Edmund" localhost:9090/hello/sayHello
